## What is the Exponea Flutter SDK?

The Exponea Flutter SDK allows you to integrate your Flutter-based mobile application with Bloomreach Engagement and track your customers' behavior in your app. Integrating the SDK in your app will enable you to track events and customer properties, send push notifications, and display in-app messages and content blocks.

The Flutter SDK is implemented as a wrapper around the native [Android](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/android-sdk) and [iOS](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/ios-sdk) SDKs.

The SDK is [available as open source on GitHub](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-flutter-sdk) for maximum transparency and includes an [example app](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/flutter-sdk-example-app) you can use as a reference implementation.

> ❗️
> 
> Always make sure to capture explicit consent before using the SDK to track and collect data.
